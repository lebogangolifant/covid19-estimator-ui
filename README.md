# Covid-19 Estimator

### Too many patients, not enough hospitals and beds. A serious shortage of ventilators, masks and other PPE - if we don ºt practice social distancing.

### Job losses or freezes, low cash flow and low production (even for essentials like food).
### These and more from too many people being sick, a sizable number dying (including some of the best people in many fields), and many others affected by the impact of losing loved ones or a world operating in slow motion
