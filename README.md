# Covid-19 Estimator

## Too many patients, not enough hospitals and beds. A serious shortage of ventilators, masks and other PPE - if we donʼt practice social distancing.

## Job losses or freezes, low cash flow and low production (even for essentials like food).
## These and more from too many people being sick, a sizable number dying (including some of the best people in many fields), and many others affected by the impact of losing loved ones or a world operating in slow motion
